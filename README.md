The multimedia company recently experienced a DDoS attack that compromised its internal network for two hours. Network services became unresponsive due to a flood of ICMP packets, preventing normal traffic from accessing resources. Investigation revealed the attack exploited an unconfigured firewall.

To mitigate this, the network security team implemented the following measures:

Firewall rules to limit incoming ICMP packets
Source IP verification to detect spoofed addresses
Network monitoring software for detecting abnormal traffic
IDS/IPS system to filter suspicious ICMP traffic
